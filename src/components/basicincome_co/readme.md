# Basicincome.co

## Pan-currency

Johan Nygren's Resilience Protocol that Basicincome.co is built on is currency-agnostic. 
The Basicincome.co DApp can be used with any financial platform online, and with any currency. 

## Crowdsourced currency-coverage

Users should be able to install new financial platforms, through providing some API data about that platform. 
A concept-example of this can be found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnvqS4fr9ng

The <b>Install new financial platforms</b> component is not a priority, and will be developed later in Q4 2015, or Q1 2016.
